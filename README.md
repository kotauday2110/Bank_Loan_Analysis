##  Data Cleaning Process

###  Dataset Overview
The dataset contained financial loan information including applicant details, employment data, loan characteristics, and performance metrics. Initial data required extensive cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.

###  Detailed Cleaning Steps

#### 1  Handling Missing and Incomplete Data
- **`emp_title` column:** Replaced missing values with placeholder `'Unknown'`
- **Text columns:** Reviewed and replaced empty/NaN values systematically
- **Numeric fields:** Validated completeness of critical financial metrics

####   Standardizing Categorical Values

**Column: `home_ownership`**
- Corrected inconsistent entries:
  - `RENTT`, `rent` ‚Üí `RENT`
  - `MORTGAgges`, `mortgage` ‚Üí `MORTGAGE`
- Applied **Power Query's Replace Values** tool for spelling corrections
- Converted entire column to **UPPERCASE** for uniformity
- Used **TRIM** function to remove extra spaces

####   Data Type Optimization
- **Financial columns:** Converted `loan_amount`, `annual_income` from text to numeric
- **Boolean fields:** Standardized loan status indicators
- **Categorical data:** Ensured proper text formatting for grouping operations

####  Date Standardization
- **Date columns:** `issue_date`, `last_credit_pull_date`
- Applied uniform `DD-MM-YYYY` format using Power Query
- Resolved date parsing inconsistencies

###  Cleaning Results
- **Data Consistency:** All categorical values standardized
- **Type Safety:** Numeric columns ready for calculations
- **Analysis Ready:** Clean dataset prepared for visualization
- **Quality Assurance:** Manual verification completed

##  DAX Functions & Measures Implementation

###  Core Business Metrics

#### Basic Portfolio Metrics
```dax
Total Loan Applications = COUNT(banking[ID])

Total Funded amount = SUM(banking[Loan_amount])

Total Amount Recieved = SUM(banking[total_payment])

Average DTI = AVERAGE(banking[dti])

Average Int rate = AVERAGE(banking[Int_rate])
```

#### Good vs Bad Loan Analysis
```dax
Good loan applications = CALCULATE([Total Loan Applications],banking[Good vs bad loan]="Good loan")

Good loan percentage = (CALCULATE([Total Loan Applications],banking[Good vs bad loan] ="Good loan"))/[Total Loan Applications]

Good funded amount = CALCULATE([Total Funded amount],banking[Good vs bad loan]="Good loan")

Good loan Recieved amount = CALCULATE([Total Amount Recieved],banking[Good vs bad loan]="Good loan")

Bad loan applications = CALCULATE([Total Loan Applications],banking[Good vs bad loan]="Bad loan")

Bad loan percentage = (CALCULATE([Total Loan Applications],banking[Good vs bad loan] ="Bad loan"))/[Total Loan Applications]

Bad funded amount = CALCULATE([Total Funded amount],banking[Good vs bad loan]="Bad loan")

Bad loan Recieved amount = CALCULATE([Total Amount Recieved],banking[Good vs bad loan]="Bad loan")
```

###  Time Intelligence Measures

#### Month-to-Date (MTD) Calculations
```dax
MTD Loan Applications = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Loan Applications],'Date'[Date]))

MTD Funded Amount = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Funded amount],'Date'[Date]))

MTD Amount Recieved = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Amount Recieved],'Date'[Date]))

MTD Int Rate = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Average Int rate],'Date'[Date]))

MTD DTI = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Average DTI],'Date'[Date]))
```

#### Previous Month-to-Date (PMTD) Calculations
```dax
PMTD Loan Applications = CALCULATE([MTD Loan Applications], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date'[Date],-1,MONTH)))

PMTD Funded Amount = CALCULATE([MTD Funded Amount], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date'[Date],-1,MONTH)))

PMTD Amount Recieved = CALCULATE([MTD Amount Recieved], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date'[Date],-1,MONTH)))

PMTD Int Rate = CALCULATE([MTD Int Rate], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date'[Date],-1,MONTH)))

PMTD DTI = CALCULATE([MTD DTI], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date'[Date],-1,MONTH)))
```

#### Month-over-Month (MOM) Growth Calculations
```dax
MOM Applications = ([MTD Loan Applications]- [PMTD Loan Applications])/[PMTD Loan Applications]

MOM Funded Amount = ([MTD Funded Amount]- [PMTD Funded Amount])/[PMTD Funded Amount]

MOM Amount Recieved = ([MTD Amount Recieved]- [PMTD Amount Recieved])/[PMTD Amount Recieved]

MOM Int Rate = ([MTD Int Rate]- [PMTD Int Rate])/[PMTD Int Rate]

MOM DTI = ([MTD DTI]- [PMTD DTI])/[PMTD DTI]
```

###  Date Table & Helper Columns
```dax
Date = CALENDAR(MIN(banking[Issue_date]), MAX(banking[Issue_date]))

month = FORMAT('Date'[Date],"mmm")

month_num = MONTH('Date'[Date])
```
